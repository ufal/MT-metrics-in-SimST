# MT-metrics-in-SimST

This is an attachement of the paper "[MT Metrics Correlate with Human Ratings of Simultaneous Speech Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08633)" that will be published at IWSLT 2023. Preprint is at https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08633 .
It analyses Continuous Rating -- human ratings data from En-De simultaneous translation task at IWSLT 2022, on 5 systems in three latency regimes on two document-level speech-to-text test sets, and correlates them with automatic MT metrics. 

There are Jupyter notebooks that we used to make analyses, system automatic evaluation scores in csv, and results in form of plots and tables that we included into the paper.
If you ask and find it useful, we can upgrade this repo. We can comment and clarify the code, and add or link candidate systems outputs, sources and references.
